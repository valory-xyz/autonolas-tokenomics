#### Checking the corrections made after C4A
##### Bridging
67. Withheld tokens could become unsynchronized by using retry-ability of bridging protocols #67
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas-findings/issues/67
[x] fixed

54. OptimismTargetDispenserL2:syncWithheldTokens is callable with no sanity check on payloads and can lead to permanent loss of withheld token amounts #54
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas-findings/issues/54
20. Users will lose all ETH sent as cost parameter in transactions to and from Optimism #20
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas-findings/issues/20
